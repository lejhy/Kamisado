Controller observes Board
Controller asks Game if its the valid move
Add observer, then initialise
Ideally specific view part observes specific parts of the model
Core only sets everything up and wire everything up

Bugs:
	In SpeedGame, when go back and then resume again, timerUI is reset, but the actual Timer is not, resulting in a TIME UP when the timerUI is still in progress.
	
TODO:
	Confirmation message on saveGame
	notify user about invalid moves
	undo doesnt work after deadlock on win
	timer in view is not hidden on new or load game, gameOver is displayed on the background from the last game when its timer runs out
	speed game time up, inconsistent round and game winner
