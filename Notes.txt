TODO:
	Points should be calculated from the Sumo Tower values
	Confirmation message on saveGame
	notify user about invalid moves

Bugs:
	AI does not differ whose turn it is and presumes they rotate
	Two consecutive deadlocks are evaluated as a game over even when the game would continue normally after the second deadlock (game over should only occur if there would be infinite deadlock situation) - could be solved by increasing the gameover deadlock count to three from two
