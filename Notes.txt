TODO:
	Points should be calculated from the Sumo Tower values
	Confirmation message on saveGame
	notify user about invalid moves

Bugs:
	TripleSumo and QuadrupleSumo pushes three pieces in front of it even if there is a gap between the first and the second (should only push what is necessary)
	SumoPush does not differ between friendly and enemy towers (should only push enemy)
	AI does not do SumoPush moves, when a Sumo is locked but can do push AI stops working, it also does not differ whose turn it is and presumes they rotate (probably related to each other)
