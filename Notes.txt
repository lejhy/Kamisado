TODO:
	Points should be calculated from the Sumo Tower values
	Confirmation message on saveGame
	notify user about invalid moves

Bugs:
	AI does not do SumoPush moves, when a Sumo is locked but can do push AI stops working, it also does not differ whose turn it is and presumes they rotate (probably related to each other)
