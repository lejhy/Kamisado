Controller observes Board
Controller asks Game if its the valid move
Add observer, then initialise
Ideally specific view part observes specific parts of the model
Core only sets everything up and wire evrything up


Bugs:
	In SpeedGame, when go back and then resume again, timerUI is reset, but the actual Timer is not, resulting in a TIME UP when the timerUI is still in progress.
	
TODO:
